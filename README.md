# python-portfolio-project-u-s-medical-insurance

This project **imports a csv file** and then performs some quick **data analyses** on the file data. It employs a helper function that I created, as well as a class with five class methods. The final class method is used to create a dictionary; this is invoked in the very last code cell of the project where I coalesce all of the (US Insurance Market Cost) client data.

This particular Python project uses an interactive notebook created with Jupyter, Version: 7.0.3. 
I find ipynb’s to be not only great for writing lessons for instruction, but also for any segmented code execution when it’s desired to include a step-by-step narrative.

My purpose in creating and posting this project is to further develop my skills and increase my knowledge in this area. Lately, I’ve been using [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python) along with other websites as my source for raw data, worthy project ideas, and programming and data science instruction.

The standard MIT open source license is used for this project.
